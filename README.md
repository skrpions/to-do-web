## FAQs

---

A list of frequently asked questions

1. **How to share the web application on a local network?**

   - Execute:

```
$ ng s --host=0.0.0.0 --port=4200 -o
```

Then I must open a web browser (chrome, firefox) from any device and enter the ip of the local network: for example: _192.168.0.106:4200_.
